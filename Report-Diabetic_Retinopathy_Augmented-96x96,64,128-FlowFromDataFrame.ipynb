    "This Jupyter Notebook uses a neural network to classify retinal images for various stages of diabetic retinopathy, a disease which can lead of blindness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference:\n",
    "* Kaggle Competition: [APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection)\n",
    "* My Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is based upon the CNN defined by: [SmallerVGGNet by Adrian Rosebrock, PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/04/16/keras-and-convolutional-neural-networks-cnns)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "* The dataset is provided as a part of the Kaggle competition:\n",
    "    * 3662 training images, with an associated CSV file containing ID code and label class for each image\n",
    "    * 1928 testing images (which I refer to as \"official test\" images), with an associated CSV file containing only the ID code for each image. Note: a subset of a broader set of testing images that will be used to calculate official scoring for the competition\n",
    "    * Each image was a color image, but with size/resolution ranging from 474x358 to 3388x2588 pixels.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* I divided the 3662 training images into 3 sets using sklearn `test_train_split`:\n",
    "    * 2197 (60%) for training\n",
    "    * 732 (20%) for validation\n",
    "    * 732 (20%) for evaluation of model accuracy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* <font color=\"blue\"><b>REFACTORED</b></font>: Now using the Keras `ImageDataGenerator` method `flow_from_dataframe` to access the training, validation, and testing images.\n",
    "    * The train.csv file provides the image `id_code` and associated `diagnosis`.  This file is read into a dataframe.\n",
    "    * `flow_from_dataframe` is then used to ready the images associated with the `id_code` entries in the dataframe.\n",
    "        \n",
    "* I defined and refined the Convolutional Neural Network:\n",
    "    * Defined the CNN model as a class based initially upon `SmallerVGGNet` (Adrian Rosebrock) and subsequently revised to refine the model's accuracy\n",
    "    * Used Keras `DataImageGenerator` and `flow_from_dataframe` to instantiate image generators linked to the training, validation, and Testing directories\n",
    "    * Initialized the model using the defined class and compiled it (specifying the Adam optimizer)\n",
    "    * Fit the model using the training image generator, with validation using the model using the validation image generator\n",
    "    * The Fit History, providing accuracy and loss at each epoch, was plotted\n",
    "    * The fitted model was then used to predict the class for each of the Official Test images\n",
    "    \n",
    "* To improve the robustness of the model, the `DataImageGenerator` instantiated for training was revised to add augmentation to introduce random rotations, translations, and other transformations of the training images used to fit the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Results\n",
    "* Refer to the Figure provided below\n",
    "* For the neural network definition specified in this notebook, the fitting history shows a maximum training accuracy of 0.702 at epoch 8 (the 9th epoch iteration).  The fitted model yielded an accuracy of 0.5829 with the validation data, with a major dip in validation accurance and loss at epoch 5.  Accuracy and loss decrease with epoch 6 for both training and validation data, suggesting that overfitting may be an issue after this iteration.\n",
    "* Across all of the CNN models I attempted, the performance of the model against the official test data was poor, with Kaggle indicating a maximum accurancy of 0.486 for the \"Private\" dataset that is not available while the competition is in-progress.  However, while this is sufficient for any meaningful real-world usage, it's reassuring that the model at least performed better than a random guess of the image class (e.g., 1/5 = 0.200)!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opportunities for Further Investigation\n",
    "* Further investigation of the effects of changes in each layer of the CNN is needed.\n",
    "* I did not check for skew in the distribution of classes in the training images.  Taking this into account during sample selection and during fitting could improve results\n"
